Musiq

What Is This?
-------------

This is a prototype for my music player called `musiq` or Musiq.

This code is a mess as I intended for this to just be a prototype,
but here I am still using it and adding to it well over a year after I started.

I _intend_ to rewrite this and have a good clean commit history and
explain each addition to the app, but life can be messy, and we'll see if that ever happens.

In the mean time, enjoy!?

If anyone pokes me about this, I will add some kind of `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

Bonus Blog Info

You can also find the related projects from that blog (which are kind of pre-cursors to this app) [here](https://github.com/quintenpalmer/quintenpalmer.github.io/tree/main/codeexamples).
